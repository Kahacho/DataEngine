            <h3>Community Health Units</h3>
            <p><li>Even though majority of community health units in every county are functional, there still exists a significant number of health units that are either non-functional, semi-functional, or closed.
                <li>This contradicts with what was envisioned in Vision 2030 since the objective was to provide a functional, efficient, and sustainable health infrastructure network in the country.
<li>For instance, counties such as Machakos, Makueni, Isiolo, and Kitui have more than half of their community health units semi-functional which is worrying.
